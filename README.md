# gfmfmt

Format your markdown into a standard format using
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

## A note on Markdown Flavours

While it may appear that Markdown is a single standard, that's not quite
true, there's lots of little extensions to it that make it not exactly
the same across the board. This is intended for use with "[GitHub
Flavoured
Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github)". You can
read more about this on the [pandoc
docs](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#markdown-variants).

The name comes from this fact: gfmfmt, GitHub Flavoured Markdown
Formatter.
